        <p>So focus, practice and move forward with CODE R11.</p>
        <h2>ACTIVE LEARNING</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Code R11, your active learning path to mastering web design and development. A project focused on
            the JavaScript ecosystem as a fundamental pillar for your learning.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>The Code R11 project was born with the aim of showing you the shortest path you should take to reduce the
            learning curve. All this, while adopting good practices and focusing your learning on a predetermined path.
            It is a learning map to web developers. Where we offer you a structured and well-defined route of the
            languages, tools and technologies that you must use in each step. Our goal is to get you to become a
            professional web developer in the shortest time possible.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is that every new programmer builds a solid foundation with the three basic pillars of modern web
            development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>That is why, in Code R11, we have organized all the information necessary for your active learning into 11
            categories. In addition, we are proud that this platform serves as a guide for your learning.</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision is to make web learning in Latin America a fun, challenging and more collaborative process. Where
            young people have access to this digital knowledge, they can learn from the main source and join the labor
            market as professionals in web development.</p>



        <h2>INFORMATION IS POWER, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THIS MATERIAL IN YOUR FAVOR</h2>
        <p>The digital world has evolved, and it has never been so easy to learn to program, develop applications and
            websites. And all this is due to the valuable content that is freely available on the Internet. Of course,
            this is possible thanks to a large community of developers and the various technology companies that share
            their courses and documentation on web design and development. In such a way that it is possible to learn
            directly from the official source with first-hand information.</p>
